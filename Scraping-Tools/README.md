## Scraping tools

The scraping tools are all installed from the Fedora repositories by the script [FedoraWorkstationInstall/install-all.bash](https://github.com/znmeb/CompJournoStick/blob/master/FedoraWorkstationInstall/install-all.bash). What's in here is a script to demonstrate the use of the Tesseract OCR engine and the PDF extraction tools. To run this, open a terminal and type
```
cd ~/CompJ<TAB>/Scrap<TAB><ENT>
./test<TAB><ENT>
```
