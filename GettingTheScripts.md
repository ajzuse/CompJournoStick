## Getting the scripts
1. Boot up Fedora 19 and log in. You'll be in the GNOME 3 desktop.
1. Download the CompJournoStick scripts. Start Firefox; it's in the 'Favorites' bar. Download the most recent 'Source code (zip)' archive file from the [Github tags page](https://github.com/znmeb/CompJournoStick/tags). 
1. Open the archive with the Archive Manager and press the 'Extract' button on the upper right. In the file selection dialog, pick your home directory and press the 'Extract' button on the lower right.
